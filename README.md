# Theo-Jansen-walking-mechanism
The Theo Jansen mechanism is a unique mechanical linkage system that mimics a natural walking motion using only rotational input and carefully designed leg linkages. Inspired by the kinetic sculptures of Dutch artist Theo Jansen, this mechanism uses a system of 12 interconnected links to transform the circular motion of a crank into a realistic walking gait. It is widely studied in engineering for its innovative motion design and serves as a practical example of converting rotary motion into linear, legged movement without the use of wheels or complex electronics.
